Full stack web app using React for teachers to administer spelling tests to their students. It was built for Barbra Morgan Elementary School to use during remote learning, but is still in use. It includes both a student and teacher portal. Teachers can manage multiple classes, put students in groups, and create spelling tests by recording audio within the browser or uploading an audio file. In the student portal, students can take their currently assigned test for a grade, take practice tests, review their past attempts, and see an overview of spelling words they commonly miss and need to work on. All requests are sent to a Electron.js API. All user data are stored in a SQL database.
